⚙️ Convex-Class Open Architecture Specification (CC-OAS)

Status: Draft v1
Audience: Senior SWE, DevOps, Platform, AI Engineers
Goal: Define a deterministic, open alternative to Convex-style platforms

⸻

1. Problem Statement

Modern “backend platforms” (Convex, Firebase, Supabase-style abstractions):
	•	Hide databases behind proprietary APIs
	•	Centralize logic in opaque runtimes
	•	Trade determinism for developer convenience
	•	Collapse trust boundaries
	•	Become impossible to reason about at scale

CC-OAS defines a system that delivers:
	•	Convex-level developer velocity
	•	Without proprietary lock-in
	•	Without hidden compute
	•	With explicit data ownership
	•	With production-grade security on day one

⸻

2. Design Goals (Hard Requirements)

G1 — Determinism
	•	Every input → output path is traceable
	•	No hidden side effects
	•	No magical runtime behavior

G2 — DB-First
	•	Database is the source of truth
	•	Business logic moves toward data, not away from it
	•	No “backend SDK owns your data”

G3 — Zero-Trust by Default
	•	Network isolation
	•	Explicit service boundaries
	•	Least privilege everywhere

G4 — Convex-Class DX
	•	Real-time capable
	•	Reactive data
	•	Simple CRUD
	•	Fast iteration

G5 — Open & Replaceable
	•	Every component is swappable
	•	No single vendor dependency
	•	No proprietary protocol requirements

3. Core Architectural Layers

┌──────────────────────────────┐
│          Frontend            │
│   (HTMX / Dioxus / Web)      │
└──────────────┬───────────────┘
               ↓
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│         Edge Layer           │
│   (Nginx, TLS, Rate Limit)   │
└──────────────┬───────────────┘
               ↓
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│     Application Control      │
│ (Directus + Hasura + Rust)   │
└──────────────┬───────────────┘
               ↓
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│        Data Plane            │
│ (Postgres, Redis, MinIO)     │
└──────────────────────────────┘

Each layer is explicit, isolated, and replaceable.

4. Data Plane Specification (The Core)

Mandatory Components

Postgres
	•	Single source of truth
	•	RLS + RBAC enabled
	•	Extensions allowed:
	•	pgvector
	•	pg_edge_vectorizer
	•	postgis (only when justified)

Redis (Optional)
	•	Ephemeral state
	•	Locks
	•	Queues
	•	Never authoritative

MinIO (Optional)
	•	Object storage
	•	Static assets
	•	Backups

📌 Rule:
If logic can be expressed in SQL safely, it belongs in the DB.

⸻

5. Application Control Layer

Directus (Primary Control Plane)
	•	CRUD
	•	Admin UI
	•	Schema governance
	•	Flows for orchestration

Acts as the “Convex mutation layer”, but transparently over Postgres.

⸻

Hasura (High-Throughput Query Plane)
	•	GraphQL over Postgres
	•	Subscription support
	•	Fine-grained permissions
	•	Optimized read paths

Acts as the “Convex query engine”, without owning your data.

⸻

Rust Services (Execution Plane)
	•	Async orchestration
	•	AI pipelines
	•	MCP servers
	•	Deterministic background work

Acts as the “Convex function runtime”, but explicit and inspectable.

⸻

6. Real-Time & Reactivity Model

Instead of a proprietary real-time engine:
	•	Postgres NOTIFY / LISTEN
	•	Hasura subscriptions
	•	Directus events
	•	Redis pub/sub (optional)

📌 Reactivity emerges from data change, not runtime magic.

⸻

7. AI / Vector / RAG Specification

Embeddings
	•	Generated locally via Ollama
	•	Stored in Postgres (pgvector)
	•	Indexed in-DB

Retrieval
	•	k-NN in SQL
	•	Dynamic-k
	•	No external retrieval engines for small/medium scale

Generation
	•	Optional
	•	Happens after retrieval
	•	Never conflated with storage

📌 This mirrors Convex’s “compute near data” philosophy — but open.

⸻

8. Security Model

Network Isolation
	•	Edge-Net
	•	Auth-Net
	•	DB-Net

Identity
	•	Vault-managed secrets
	•	No inline secrets
	•	No public DB access

Access Control
	•	Postgres RLS
	•	Hasura permissions
	•	Directus RBAC

📌 Security is structural, not policy-based.

⸻

9. Deployment & Operations

Containers
	•	Rootless
	•	Deterministic
	•	Same image for dev / CI / prod

Healthchecks
	•	Liveness
	•	Readiness
	•	Dependency-aware

Postmortems
	•	Mandatory
	•	Blameless
	•	Action-driven

📌 Operational discipline is part of the spec.

10. What Makes This “Convex-Class”

Convex Feature	CC-OAS Equivalent
Reactive data	DB-driven reactivity
Server functions	Rust services
Transactions	Postgres
Auth rules	RLS + RBAC
Real-time	Subscriptions
DX	Opinionated defaults

But:
	•	No vendor lock-in
	•	No opaque runtime
	•	No proprietary protocol

⸻

11. Explicit Non-Goals
	•	No magic global state
	•	No hidden compute billing
	•	No “just trust the platform”
	•	No closed source runtime
	•	No replacing SQL with abstractions

⸻

12. Summary (The Thesis)

Convex solved developer experience by hiding systems.
CC-OAS solves developer experience by making systems legible.

This architecture assumes:
	•	You want to own your data
	•	You want to reason about failure
	•	You want Convex-level speed without Convex-level opacity
