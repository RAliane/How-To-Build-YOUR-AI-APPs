# 🧱 Superstack Architecture Rulebook

**Deterministic · Zero-Trust · DB-First · Production-Ready**

This repository documents an opinionated, real-world architecture standard for building modern web + AI systems without vendor lock-in, hidden runtimes, or abstraction debt.

**It is not a framework.**
**It is not a starter kit.**
**It is a systems rulebook.**

If you’ve ever asked:
- “Why does this platform feel magical until prod?”
- “Where exactly does my data live?”
- “Why does scaling break everything?”

This repo is the answer I wish existed earlier.

## What This Is

A Convex-class open architecture specification built from:
- First-principles systems design
- Database-first thinking
- Zero-trust networking
- Deterministic builds and deployments
- Real production failure modes

It reflects how senior engineers actually ship and operate systems, not how platforms market themselves.

---

## What This Is Not

❌ A tutorial
❌ A “10x dev” productivity hack
❌ A replacement for thinking
❌ A proprietary platform

This assumes you are comfortable with:
- Linux
- Containers
- Databases
- Networking
- Reading documentation

---

## Core Principles

- Determinism over convenience
- Databases are the source of truth
- Compute moves toward data
- Zero-trust by default
- Minimize abstractions
- Design for failure, not demos
- Own your stack end-to-end
