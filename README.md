# 🧱 Superstack Architecture Rulebook

**Deterministic · Zero-Trust · DB-First · Production-Ready**

This repository documents an opinionated, real-world architecture standard for building modern web + AI systems without vendor lock-in, hidden runtimes, or abstraction debt.

**It is not a framework.**
**It is not a starter kit.**
**It is a systems rulebook.**

If you’ve ever asked:
- “Why does this platform feel magical until prod?”
- “Where exactly does my data live?”
- “Why does scaling break everything?”

This repo is the answer I wish existed earlier.

---

## What This Is

A Convex-class open architecture specification built from:
- First-principles systems design
- Database-first thinking
- Zero-trust networking
- Deterministic builds and deployments
- Real production failure modes

It reflects how senior engineers actually ship and operate systems, not how platforms market themselves.

---

## What This Is Not

❌ A tutorial
❌ A “10x dev” productivity hack
❌ A replacement for thinking
❌ A proprietary platform

This assumes you are comfortable with:
- Linux
- Containers
- Databases
- Networking
- Reading documentation

---

## Core Principles

- Determinism over convenience
- Databases are the source of truth
- Compute moves toward data
- Zero-trust by default
- Minimize abstractions
- Design for failure, not demos
- Own your stack end-to-end

Each file is self-contained, explicit, and written to be read independently.

## File Overview

### 📘 RULEBOOK.md

The operating doctrine.

Defines:
- Network isolation rules
- Security boundaries
- Data ownership principles
- Tooling constraints
- What is allowed vs forbidden

**If you only read one file — read this.**

---

### 🧩 PODMAN-COMPOSE_REF.md

A production-first Podman Compose reference implementing the rulebook.

Includes:
- Triple network isolation
- Service placement
- Secrets handling
- Healthchecks
- Deterministic container usage

This is how the rules turn into infrastructure.

---

### ❤️ HEALTHCHECK.md

Standards for:
- Liveness checks
- Readiness checks
- Dependency awareness
- Blameless postmortems
- Incident severity classification

This file exists because most outages are operational, not technical.

---

### ⚙️ CC-OAS.md

**Convex-Class Open Architecture Specification**

A formal architecture spec describing:
- How to achieve Convex-level DX
- Without proprietary runtimes
- Without opaque data ownership
- With explicit systems boundaries

Written like an internal RFC, not marketing copy.

---

### 🧠 LinkedIn.md

A concise public narrative explaining:
- Why this architecture exists
- What problem it solves
- How to talk about it without sounding insane online

Optional — but useful.

---

## Who This Is For

This repo is for:
- Senior SWE / DevOps / Platform engineers
- AI engineers who care about data gravity
- Founders who want to own their infrastructure
- Teams burned by “backend as a service” abstractions
- Anyone transitioning from tool user → systems thinker

---

## How To Use This Repo

- Use it as a reference, not a checklist
- Copy patterns, not blindly configs
- Adapt it to your constraints
- Argue with it — that’s the point

If it forces you to think more clearly about your system, it’s working.

---

## Final Note

Good systems feel boring.
Bad systems feel magical — until they fail.

This repository exists to make systems legible, auditable, and operable from day one.

**No hype.**
**No magic.**
**Just architecture.**
